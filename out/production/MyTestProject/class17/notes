A constructor is a special
 method that is automatically called when
  an object of a class is created.
   It is used to initialize the object
    with the values provided as arguments
     to the constructor. If no constructor is defined
      in a class,
 a default constructor is automatically created by Java.
 1. constructor - the same name as class name
 2.dont have return type not even void
 3. when you dont create a contsructor is a class
 - Java creates a default contsructor for us automatically
behind the scenes - default constructer.
